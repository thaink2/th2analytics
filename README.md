[https://github.com/thaink2/th2analytics](https://github.com/thaink2/th2analytics) using the command

```r
remotes::install_github("thaink2/th2analytics")
```

Prepare your data and call the forecasting API, as illustrated below:

```r
api_token <- "*****" # get your token here: https://opensource.thaink2.com/app/th2token

historical_data <- ggplot2::economics_long

th2fcast <-  th2analytics::th2forecast_api(
  input_data = historical_data,
  api_token = api_token,
  fcast_horizon = 30,
  target_var = "value",
  date_var = "date",
  group_target = "variable",
  models_list = c("xgboost")) # xgboost, random_forest, arima
```
